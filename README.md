1. All requirements meet, no errors, site runs smooth!

1. In lighthouse- 'largest contentful paint' measures to 2.9 sec, under 'needs improvement'.

1. Profile pictures could be stored with unique id's to make sure they wont be replacing eachother

1. Project is well structured and easy to understand

1. It's a bit unclear at first, how to change password

1. Posts have 1 like after being made

1. Css is great but sometimes things feel a bit too big

1. Some statements could be made into functions

1. Likes column in the likes table(?)

1. In some places I'm expecting function instead of queries. Perhaps you know better!

Great work! Hard time to find misstakes. Learning a lot by reviewing this code.
